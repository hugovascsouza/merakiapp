# Meraki
## Discover Online Coaches and Teachers
Meraki is a personal project designed to connect clients with a wide range of experts offering personalized guidance in areas such as fitness, nutrition, mental well-being, and skill development. 
Whether you're looking to achieve specific goals or explore new hobbies, Meraki makes it easy to find the right coach to meet your needs.

This is an ongoing project, and I am currently developing the back end to enhance functionality and scalability.

## Tech Stack
Front End: React, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS.
Back End (In Progress): Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

## Core Features (MVP)
Search and Filter Functionality: Easily discover coaches by category, including physical training, nutrition, mindfulness, and skill-building activities.
Dynamic Expert Profiles: View detailed profiles with qualifications, services offered, locations, and user reviews.
User-Friendly Interface: A responsive and intuitive design ensures seamless navigation on desktop devices.

## Ongoing Development
Designing and implementing the back end to manage user authentication, profile updates, and scheduling.
Developing APIs to enable smooth communication between the front-end and back-end systems.
Creating scalable and secure database schemas for efficient data storage and retrieval.
